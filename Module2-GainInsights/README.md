<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that orchestrates and automates the movement and transformation of data. It works across on-premises and cloud data sources and SaaS to ingest, prepare, transform, analyze, and publish your data.

Transformation activities in Azure Data Factory transform and process your raw data into predictions and insights. The transformation activity executes in a computing environment such as Azure HDInsight cluster or an Azure Batch. You will create an HDInsight Hive activity to execute a Hive query.

Azure SQL Data Warehouse is an enterprise-class, distributed database capable of processing massive volumes of relational and non-relational data. It's the industry's first cloud data warehouse that combines proven SQL capabilities with the ability to grow, shrink, and pause in seconds. SQL Data Warehouse is also deeply ingrained into Azure, and you'll use Data Factory to move generated statistics into SQL Data Warehouse and visualize it in Power BI.

In this module, you'll use Data Factory to compose services into managed data flow pipelines to transform the data ingested from the Parts Unlimited logs into meaningful data to be visualized using Power BI.

<a name="Setup"></a>
### Setup ###
In order to run the exercises in this module, you'll need to create an HDI cluster, a SQL Data Warehouse, a storage account (or reuse one from previous module) and upload some asset files. You can do this manually or run the **Setup.cmd** script in the **Setup** folder as detailed below.

> **Important:** when entering the names for the storage account, SQL DW server and HDInsight server, those must be **globally unique**. To ensure this, you can use your first and last name as prefixes for the resource names. For instance: "johndoestorage", "johndoehdi" and "johndoesqlserver".

<a name="ManualSetupHDI"></a>
#### Manual Setup 1: Creating the HDI cluster ####

1. In the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), create a new HDI cluster (_New > Data + Analytics > HDInsight_).

1. Enter a globally unique name for the cluster.

1. Select **Hadoop** cluster type.

	HDInsight allows to deploy a variety of cluster types, for different data analytics workloads. Cluster types offered are:

	- **_Hadoop**: for query and analysis workloads_
	- **HBase**: for NoSQL workloads
	- **Storm**: for real time event processing workloads
	- **Spark**: for in-memory processing, interactive queries, stream, and machines learning workloads.

1. Select an _operating system_ for the cluster (you can choose between either Windows or Linux) and **use the latest version** ("Hadoop 2.7.0 (HDI 3.3)" or latest)

1. Select the same Resource Group as the used for the Storage account ("**DataCodeLab**").

1. Configure the cluster login credentials (for instance: **admin/myP@ssw0rd**) and the SSH creadetials if using Linux. Enable **Remote Desktop**. You will use the cluster credentails to access the Hive dashboard (for Windows) or Ambari portal (for Linux) when testing the HQL queries.

1. Create a new storage account for the _data source_ and use "**hdi**" for the default container name.

1. You can use 1 for the worker nodes number and the lowest pricing tiers for this module.

1. Click **Create**. The provisioning may take 15 minutes to complete.

	_Create HDI cluster_

> **Note:** For this module we don't need to persist the cluster when deleted, so we won't configure a Hive and Oozie metastore for it. 

> Using the metastore helps you to retain your Hive and Oozie metadata, so that you don't need to re-create Hive tables or Oozie jobs when you create a new cluster. By default, Hive uses an embedded Azure SQL database to store this information. The embedded database can't preserve the metadata when the cluster is deleted.

> In order to configure Oozie or Hive metadata Database, first you need to create the SQL Database. To do this, navigate to _New > Data + Storage > SQL Database_ and create a _blank database_ in the same resource group that you want to use for the HDI cluster.

> ![Create a SQL Database](Images/creating-the-sql-database.png?raw=true "Create a SQL Database")

> _Create a SQL Database_

> Then, select _Optional Configuration_ in the _New HDInsight Cluster_. Select _External Metastores_ in the _Optional Configuration_ blade and choose to use an existing SQL Database, selcting the one you created before.

#### Manual Setup 2: Manually creating the SQL Data Warehouse ####

1. In the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), create a new SQL Data Warehouse (_New > Data + Storage > SQL Data Warehouse_).

1. Enter "**partsunlimited**" for the database name.

1. The minimun performance of 100 DWU will be enough for this module.

1. Create a new SQL Server for hosting the Data Warehouse.
	1. Select **Create a new server** in the Server blade.
	1. Enter a globally unique name for the server.
	1. Enter a admin login name: **dwadmin**
	1. Write a password for the server login: **P@ssword123**
	1. Repeat the password to confirm it.
	1. Select the same location used for the other services.

1. Use **Blank database** for the source so a new empty database is used (it will use the "partsunlimited" name).

1. Select the resource group used for all the services: **DataCodeLab**.

	![Create SQL Data Warehouse](Images/setup-create-dw.png?raw=true "SQL Data Warehouse")

 1. Make sure to use the "_Resource Manager_" for the deployment mode.
 1. Select the "_Standard Locally Redundant_" (Standard-LRS) storage account type.
 1. Create a new _Resource Group_ (for instance "**DataCodeLab**") and make sure to use the same when creating the HDI cluster, SQL Data Warehouse and Data Factory.
 1. Select a location (for instance **West US**) and make sure to use the same for the other services.
 1. Click **Create**.

	![New storage account](Images/setup-new-storage.png?raw=true "New storage account")

	_New storage account_

1. Open Windows Explorer and browse to the module's **Setup** folder.

1. Right-click **GenerateData.cmd** and select **Run as Administrator** to generate the sample data files and exit the script. The files will be generated in **Setup\Assets\logs** using date partitioned folders.

	> **Note:** Azure Data Factory supports partitioned data. You can specify a dynamic folder path and file name for time series data with the "partitionedBy" section when defining the pipeline activities, also using Data Factory macros and the system variables: SliceStart and SliceEnd, which indicate start and end times for a given data slice. For example:
	> 
	> ````JavaScript
		"folderPath": "partsunlimited/logs/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
		"partitionedBy": 
		 [
			 { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
			 { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } }, 
			 { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } }
		],
	> ````

1. Go back to the Azure portal and check if the storage provisioning is complete. **Take note of the storage account name and key values from the settings pane**.

## Exercises ##
This module includes the following exercises:

1. [Creating Azure Data Factory](#Exercise1)
1. [Creating Hive code to do analytics on your data](#Exercise2)
1. [Orchestrating Azure Data Factory workflow](#Exercise3)
1. [Using the data in the warehouse to generate Power BI visualizations](#Exercise4)

Estimated time to complete this module: **60 minutes**

<a name="Exercise1"></a>
### Exercise 1: Creating Azure Data Factory ###

Azure Data Factory has a few key entities that work together to define the input and output data, processing events, and the schedule and resources required to execute the desired data flow.

- **Activities**: Activities define the actions to perform on your data. Each activity takes zero or more datasets as inputs and produces one or more datasets as outputs.
- **Pipelines**: Pipelines are a logical grouping of Activities. They are used to group activities into a unit that together perform a task (i.e. clean log).
- **Datasets**: Datasets are named references/pointers to the data you want to use as an input or an output of an Activity. Datasets identify data structures within different data stores including tables, files, folders, and documents.
- **Linked service**: Linked services define the information needed for Data Factory to connect to external resources (data stores or compute resources for hosting activities execution).

In this exercise, you'll create a Data Factory with the linked services (Azure Storage, HDI cluster and SQL Data Warehouse) and datasets for the ingest data and output stores.

	_New Azure storage data store_

1. Replace **<****accountname****>** and **<****accountkey****>** placeholders with the account name and key values of the Azure storage account where the Parts Unlimited logs are stored (created with Setup.cmd script or with manual steps).

	````JavaScript
	{
		 "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
		 "properties": {
			  "type": "AzureStorage",
			  "description": "",
			  "typeProperties": {
					"connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
			  }
		 }
	}
	````

    See [JSON Scripting Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=516971&clcid=0x409) for details about JSON properties.

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to deploy the **StorageLinkedService**.

	![Deploy linked service](Images/ex1task2-deploy.png?raw=true "Deploy linked service")

	_Deploy linked service_

	![Linked service deployed successfully](Images/ex1task2-deployed.png?raw=true "Linked service deployed successfully")

	_Linked service deployed successfully_

1. Repeat to create another service for the SQL Data Warehouse server. Click **New data store** button on the toolbar and select **Azure SQL Data Warehouse** from the drop down menu.

1. Replace placeholders in the connectionString (**<****servername****>**, **<****databasename****>**, **<****username****>** and **<****password****>**) with the setting values used when creating the SQL Data Warehouse database in setup script.

	````JavaScript
	{
		 "name": "AzureSqlDWLinkedService",
		 "properties": {
			  "type": "AzureSqlDW",
			  "description": "",
			  "typeProperties": {
					"connectionString": "Data Source=tcp:<servername>.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=partsunlimited;User ID=dwadmin@<servername>;Password=P@ssword123;Integrated Security=False;Encrypt=True;Connect Timeout=30"
			  }
		 }
	}
	````

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to create and deploy the **AzureSqlDWLinkedService**.

1. Now, click **New compute** button on the toolbar and select **HDInsight cluster** from the drop down menu. You should see the JSON template for creating the *HDInsight cluster linked service* in the right pane.

    > **Note**: Alternatively, you can use a [On Demand HDInsight cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/data-factory-compute-linked-services/#azure-hdinsight-on-demand-linked-service), but it will take around 15 minutes to create the cluster when running the Data Factory. Use this approach only if the provided cluster is not available and make sure to specify the proper password.

1. Update the setting placeholders as shown in the snippet below. Replace the **<****hdiclustername****>** placeholder with the name you used when running the **Setup.cmd** script or with manual steps.

	````JavaScript
	{
        "name": "HDInsightLinkedService",
        "properties": {
            "type": "HDInsight",
            "description": "",
            "typeProperties": {
                "clusterUri": "https://<hdiclustername>.azurehdinsight.net/",
                "userName": "admin",
                "password": "P@ssword123",
                "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService"
            }
        }
    }
	````

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to create and deploy the **HDInsightLinkedService**.

	![Linked services created](Images/ex1task2-linked-services.png?raw=true "Linked services created")

	_Linked services created_

    > **Note:** if the deployment fails, it may be due to the HDI cluster is still being provisioned. Verify the status in the portal.

<a name="Ex1Task3"></a>
#### Task 3 - Creating the input and output datasets ####

In this task, you'll create the input and output tables corresponding to the linked services.

1. In the Editor for the Data Factory, click **New dataset** button on the toolbar and click **Azure Blob storage** from the drop down menu.

1. Change the **name** propety to "LogJsonFromBlob" and the **linkedServiceName** property to "AzureStorageLinkedService".

1. Remove the **structure** property. The file is in JSON format and the structure can be omitted.

1. Change the **typeProperties** to use the _/year/month/day_ partition for the blob paths.

	````JavaScript
	"typeProperties": {
		"folderPath": "partsunlimited/logs/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
		"partitionedBy": 
		[
			 { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
			 { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } }, 
			 { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } }
		],
		"format": {
			"type": "TextFormat"
		}
	},
	````

1. Set the availability frequency to daily.

	````JavaScript
	"availability": {
		"frequency": "Day",
		"interval": 1
	},
	````

1. Add an **external** property to the dataset and set it to **true**. This setting informs the Data Factory service that this table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

	````JavaScript
	"external": true
	````

    The final _LogJsonFromBlob_ dataset should look like the following snippet:
    
	````JavaScript
	{
		"name": "LogJsonFromBlob",
		"properties": {
			"type": "AzureBlob",
			"linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
			"typeProperties": {
				"folderPath": "partsunlimited/logs/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",

### Exercise 2: Creating Hive code to do analytics on your data ###

**HDInsight** is a cloud implementation on **Microsoft Azure** of the rapidly expanding **Apache Hadoop** technology stack that is the go-to solution for big data analysis.

**Apache Hive** is a data warehouse system for Hadoop, which enables data summarization, querying, and analysis of data by using **HiveQL** (a query language similar to SQL). Hive can be used to interactively explore your data or to create reusable batch processing jobs.

In this exercise, you'll create a **Hive activity** using HQL script code to generate the output data in the Azure Storage linked service.

<a name="Ex2Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Writing a Hive query to analyze the logs ####

In this task, you'll write a Hive query to generate product stats (views and cart additions) from the Parts Unlimited logs.

1. Navigate to the HDInsight server dashboard: https://**{hdiclustername}**.azurehdinsight.net/. If the HDI server was created with _Linux_ the **Ambari** portal will be loaded.

1. Log in using the username 'admin' and password 'P@ssword123'

1. If the HDI cluster was created using **Hadoop on Windows** (default when using Setup scripts), follow these steps:

	1. Open the **Hive Editor** using the link in the top bar if the HDI cluster is running _Windows_. 

	1. Write HQL code to create a partitioned table for the existing blobs and then parse the JSON format. Paste the snippet below, replace the **<****StorageAccountName****>** and update the partition to be of a valid date and location (where the input logs were uploaded according to the current date):

		````SQL
		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS LogsRaw;
		CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE LogsRaw (jsonentry string) 
		STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION "wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/2016/03/30";

		ALTER TABLE LogsRaw ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=2016, month=03, day=30) LOCATION 'wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/2016/03/30';

		SELECT CAST(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.productid") as BIGINT),
				 get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.title"),
				 get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.category"),
				 get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.type"),
				 CAST(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.totalClicked") as BIGINT)
		FROM LogsRaw;
		````

		> **Note**: The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE command that we used here, creates an external table, the data file can be located outside the default container and does not move the data file.

		![Hive editor](Images/ex2task1-hive-editor.png?raw=true "Hive editor")

		_Hive editor_

	1. Enter a name, e.g. "**Product Stats**", for the query and click **Submit** to create a job session for the query execution.

	1. Notice the new entry in the **Job Session** table and the status. It will say Initializing and then, Running.

		![Job session state](Images/ex2task1-job-session.png?raw=true "Job session state")

		_Job session state_

	1. Wait for the status to be Completed, click the query name to view the details. Notice the **Job Output** with the resulting values.

		_Query output_

1. If the HDI cluster was created using **Hadoop on Linux**, follow these steps:

	1. Select the **Hive view** in the views button at the top bar.

		![Hive view option in Ambari](Images/ex2task1-ambari-hive-option.png?raw=true "Hive view option in Ambari")

		_Hive view option in Ambari_

	1. In the new worksheet, write HQL code to create a partitioned table for the existing blobs and then parse the JSON format. Paste the snippet below, replace the **<****StorageAccountName****>** and update the partition to be of a valid date and location (where the input logs were uploaded according to the current date):

		````SQL
		DROP TABLE IF EXISTS LogsRaw;
		CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE LogsRaw (jsonentry string) 
		STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION "wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/2016/03/30";

		ALTER TABLE LogsRaw ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=2016, month=03, day=30) LOCATION 'wasb://partsunlimited@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs/2016/03/30';

		SELECT CAST(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.productid") as BIGINT),
				 get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.title"),
				 get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.category"),
				 get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.type"),
				 CAST(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.totalClicked") as BIGINT)
		FROM LogsRaw;
		````

		> **Note**: The CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE command that we used here, creates an external table, the data file can be located outside the default container and does not move the data file.

		![Hive editor](Images/ex2task1-ambari-hive-editor.png?raw=true "Hive editor")

		_Hive editor_

	1. Click **Execute** to run the query.

	1. Wait for the status to be Succeeded, select the results tab in the "Query Process Results" panel to show the values.

		![Query output](Images/ex2task1-ambari-query-output.png?raw=true "Query output")

		_Query output_

	> **Note:** Ambari portal offers many features over the Windows dashboard. You can create advanced visualization of the data results using charts, customize the Hive settings, create customized views, among many other options. To learn more about Ambari portal go to [Manage HDInsight clusters by using the Ambari Web UI](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari/).

1. Write a new Hive query to create the output partitioned table using a columns schema matching the output of the previous query. Paste the snippet below and replace the **StorageAccountName** placeholder.

	````SQL
	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS OutputTable;
	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE OutputTable (
		productid int,
		title string,
		category string,
		type string,
		totalClicked int
	) PARTITIONED BY (year int, month int, day int) 
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION 'wasb://processeddata@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/logs';
	````

1. **Submit** or **execute** the Hive query to create the output table.

<a name="Ex2Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Create the HQL script for the Hive Activity ####

In this task, you'll reuse the Hive query to generate the HQL script for the Hive activity that will generate the output stats in a new storage blob.

1. Open the file located in **Setup\Assets\Scripts\logstocsv.hql** and review its content:

	````SQL
	INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE OutputTable Partition (year=${hiveconf:Year}, month=${hiveconf:Month}, day=${hiveconf:Day})
SELECT CAST(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.productid") as BIGINT) as productid,
         get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.title") as title,
         get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.category") as category,
         get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.type") as type,
         CAST(get_json_object(jsonentry, "$.totalClicked") as BIGINT) as totalClicked
FROM LogsRaw
	````

    Notice this script is, essentially, the Hive query you wrote and tested in the previous task but it insert the results in the output table.

1. Open the file located in **Setup\Assets\Scripts\addpartitions.hql** and review its content:

	````SQL
	ALTER TABLE LogsRaw ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=${hiveconf:Year}, month=${hiveconf:Month}, day=${hiveconf:Day}) LOCATION 'wasb://partsunlimited@${hiveconf:StorageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/logs/${hiveconf:Year}/${hiveconf:Month}/${hiveconf:Day}';

	ALTER TABLE OutputTable ADD IF NOT EXISTS PARTITION (year=${hiveconf:Year}, month=${hiveconf:Month}, day=${hiveconf:Day}) LOCATION 'wasb://processeddata@${hiveconf:StorageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/logs/${hiveconf:Year}/${hiveconf:Month}/${hiveconf:Day}';
	````

    This script adds the partitiones by date to the input and output tables. The storage account name and all the required date components for the partitiones will be passed as parameters by the Hive action running in the Data Factory.

1. These script was already uploaded to your storage during the module setup by using the manual steps or the **Setup.cmd** script. Verify the HQL script was uploaded by using the an storage explorer tool such as **Azure Storage Explorer** to navigate to the **Scripts** folder in the **partsunlimited** container.

	1. Open **Azure Storage Explorer**, right click on "Storage Account" tree item and select **Attach External Storage...**

		![Attaching to external storage](Images/ex2task2-explorer-add-account.png?raw=true "Attaching to external storage")

### Exercise 3: **Orchestrating Azure Data Factory workflow** ###

**Azure Data Factory** enables you to compose data movement and data processing tasks as a data driven workflow. In this exercise, you'll learn how to build your first pipeline that uses HDInsight to transform and analyze the logs from the Parts Unlimited web site.

<a name="Ex3Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Create the pipeline that will run the Hive activity ####

**Pipeline** is a logical grouping of Activities. They are used to group activities into a unit that performs a task.

**Activities** define the actions to perform on your data. Each activity takes zero or more datasets as inputs and produces one or more datasets as output. An activity is a unit of orchestration in Azure Data Factory.

An _HDInsight Hive activity_ executes Hive queries on a _HDInsight_ cluster.

In this task, you'll create the pipeline to generate the stats output using a _HDInsight Hive activity_.

1. Go back to the Azure Portal and open the **Data Factory**.

1. In the **Author and Deploy** blade of the Data Factory, click **New dataset** button on the toolbar and select **Azure Blob Storage**. We will create a dummy dataset for the Hive activity that runs the addpartitions.hql script that does not requires any input/output dataset in the data factory.

1. Update the dataset JSON to the following snippet and click **Deploy** to create the dummy dataset.

	````JavaScript
	{
		 "name": "DummyDataset",
		 "properties": {
			  "type": "AzureBlob",
			  "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
			  "typeProperties": {
					"folderPath": "dummy",
					"format": {
						 "type": "TextFormat"
					}
			  },
			  "availability": {

1. Change the **name** to "JsonLogsToTabularPipeline" and set the description to "Create tabular data using Hive".

1. Set the **start** date to be 3 days before the current date (for instance: "2016-04-29T00:00:00Z").

1. Set the **end** date to be tomorrow.

1. Add a Hive activity to run the "addpartitions.hql" script located in the storage at "partsunlimited\Scripts\addpartitions.hql" and pass the slice date components as parameters. Make sure to replace the **<****StorageAccountName****>** placeholder with the storage account name:

	````JavaScript
	"activities": [
		{
			 "name": "CreatePartitionHiveActivity",
			 "type": "HDInsightHive",
			 "linkedServiceName": "HDInsightLinkedService",
			 "typeProperties": {
				  "scriptPath": "partsunlimited\\Scripts\\addpartitions.hql",
				  "scriptLinkedService": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
				  "defines": {
				      "StorageAccountName": "<StorageAccountName>",
				      "Year": "$$Text.Format('{0:yyyy}', SliceStart)",
				      "Month": "$$Text.Format('{0:MM}', SliceStart)",
				      "Day": "$$Text.Format('{0:dd}', SliceStart)"
				  }
			 },
			 "inputs": [
				{ "name": "LogJsonFromBlob" }
			 ],
			 "outputs": [
				{ "name": "DummyDataset" }
			 ],
			 "scheduler": {
				  "frequency": "Day",
				  "interval": 1
			 }
		}
	],
	````

	This activity will run the **addpartitions.hql** script to create the date partition corresponding to the current slice.

1. Add another Hive activity to run the "logstocsv.hql" script located in the storage at "partsunlimited\Scripts\logtostats.hql" and pass the slice date components as parameters:

	````JavaScript
	"activities": [
		{
			 //...
		},
		{
			 "name": "ProcessDataHiveActivity",
			 "type": "HDInsightHive",
			 "linkedServiceName": "HDInsightLinkedService",
			 "typeProperties": {
				  "scriptPath": "partsunlimited\\Scripts\\logstocsv.hql",
				  "scriptLinkedService": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
				  "defines": {
				      "Year": "$$Text.Format('{0:yyyy}', SliceStart)",
				      "Month": "$$Text.Format('{0:MM}', SliceStart)",
				      "Day": "$$Text.Format('{0:dd}', SliceStart)"
				  }
			 },
			 "inputs": [
				  { "name": "LogJsonFromBlob" }
			 ],
			 "outputs": [
				  { "name": "LogCsvFromBlob" }
			 ],
			 "scheduler": {
				  "frequency": "Day",
				  "interval": 1
			 }
		}
	],
	````

1. Click **Deploy** on the toolbar to create and deploy the pipeline.

<a name="Ex3Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Create a new pipeline to move the HDI output to SQL Data Warehouse ####
In this task, you'll create a new pipeline to move the Hive activity output (stored in a blob) to the SQL Data Warehouse database so it can be consumed using Power BI in the next exercise.

1. In the **Author and Deploy** blade of the Data Factory, click **New pipeline** button on the toolbar (click ellipsis button if you don't see the New pipeline button).

1. Change the **name** to "LogsToDWPipeline" and set the description to "Move blob data to SQL Data Warehouse".

1. Set the **start** date to be 2 days before the current date.

1. Set the **end** date to be tomorrow.

1. Add a Move activity to move the generated tabular blobs to the SQL Data Warehouse. Make sure to replace the **<****StorageAccountName****>** placeholder with the storage account name:

	````JavaScript
	"activities": [
		{
			"type": "Copy",
			"name": "LogsToDWActivity",
			"typeProperties": {
				"source": {
					"type": "BlobSource"
				},
				"sink": {
					"type": "SqlDWSink"

1. Confirm you want to pause the data warehouse.

	Unique to SQL Data Warehouse is the ability to _pause_ and _resume_ compute on demand. If the team will not be using the Data Warehouse instance for a period of time, like nights, weekends, certain holidays or for any other reason, you can pause the Data Warehouse instance for that period of time and pick up where you left off when you return. 

	> **Note:** Since storage is separate from compute, your storage is unaffected by pause and you can continue having access to it. For instance, using Power BI as you will do in next exercise.

#### Task 2 - Create Reports in Power BI ####
A **Power BI report** is one or more pages of visualizations (charts and graphs). A **dashboard** is a single canvas that contains one or more tiles that you can use to connect to multiple datasets and display visualizations from many different reports.

In this task, you'll create a report based on the SQL Data Warehouse dataset you created.

1. Click the **Azure SQL Data Warehouse** tile from your dashboard to create a new report.

	_Azure SQL Data Warehouse tile_

	In the navigation pane, your reports are listed under the **Reports** heading. Each listed report represents one or more pages of visualizations based on one or more of the underlying datasets.

1. In the _Fields_ pane, check **category** and **views** from the **ProductStats** table.

	![Product fields](Images/ex4task2-fields.png?raw=true "Product fields")

	_Product fields_

1. You will see a table showing the product categories with the total views.

	![Categories view table](Images/ex4task2-product-views-table.png?raw=true "Categories view table")

	_Categories view table_

1. Select the **Stacked columns chart** in the _Visualizations_ pane.

	_Categories view chart_

	> **Note:** Chart values will differ since the values are randomly generated when creating the input data files in the setup script.

1. Now lets create a new chart, click the canvas, outside the table, and check the fields **title** and **views**.

1. Select the **Pie chart** visualization.

	![Products pie chart](Images/ex4task2-categories-pie.png?raw=true "Products pie chart")

	_Products pie chart_

    You can continue creating charts using any combination of fields and also apply filters and other operations. Then, you can change the report layout, add labels, shapes and other visual objects.

1. When you're done with your report, go to **File** > **Save** and enter a name for your report.
